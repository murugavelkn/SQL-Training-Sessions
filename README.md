## Pedagogy

This course developed for the Training Session for who are all know about SQL basic. The course and the example Exercise are built based on live streaming data. This course may helpful to anyone to know the syntax of the commands and the query examples to build their required task queries to bring outputs using this.

In addition, this is not for only SQL Serve, this may give knowledge for MySQL, Access, ORACLE Database concepts. The basic syntax is the same for all but in some special cases may have some changes in query writings.


## Each lesson includes:

- Optional sketchnote
- Optional supplemental video
- Pre-lesson warmup quiz
- Written lesson
- For project-based lessons, step-by-step guides on how to build the project
- Knowledge checks
- A challenge
- Supplemental reading
- Assignment
- Post-lesson quiz

> **A note about quizzes**: All quizzes are contained [in this app](https://red-water-0103e7a0f.azurestaticapps.net/), for 40 total quizzes of three questions each. They are linked from within the lessons but the quiz app can be run locally; follow the instruction in the `quiz-app` folder. They are gradually being localized.

## Offline access

You can run this documentation offline by using [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/). Fork this repo, [install Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/quickstart) on your local machine,  then in the root folder of this repo, type `docsify serve`. The website will be served on port 3000 on your localhost: `localhost:3000`.

> Note, notebooks will not be rendered via Docsify, so when you need to run a notebook, do that separately in VS Code running a Python kernel.
